I'm not too concerned about the lack of in-depth experience in developing articles because he has contributed so much to the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Guild of Copy Editors|Guild of Copy Editors]] backlog drives: as his [[User:BDD/Barnstars|his barnstars]] attest, he has often been on the leaderboard. We don't all need to take the same route to adminship. My only quibble is a very minor one - what's with all the edits to his user talk archives?

Concerns about relative lack of content creation are misplaced; administrative functions are only tangential to content writing, which is the reason that some of the best writers are not administrators and some of the best administrators do little in the way of mainspace content creation.

Or at least, we're not supposed to be - we're supposed to be a serving class. I know there are some admins who think they're the bosses, and I've clashed with one or two of them in my time. But I do think that those who are best at creating content should create content and those who can serve best by protecting and assisting them in that task should become admins (though I would like to see more overlap in the two roles). So when evaluating candidates at RfA, my final decision to some extent comes down to whether I think they have a "serving" or a "ruling" mentality - and I think BDD fits in the former category quite easily. --

Wikipedia is, after all, an encyclopedia, and our principal purpose is to create good content; that purpose includes all users, including admins.  That having been said, I think BDD has demonstrated he knows how to write well enough in the English vernacular, and how to create an encyclopedia article based on a dozen or more among the 38 articles he has created.  Sure, I would love to see several Good Articles among his accomplishments, but he's also shown that he has a strong command of policy and a head full of good sense.

I agree with Malleus and others below, knowledge of content creation is important in administrators, but I disagree it's important in all administrators. Wikipedia, as a project, needs a wide variety of different 'types' of administrators, it's nice we have some who focus on images, others who focus on templates and yet more who try and deal with the vandalism that's so prevalent. WP exists in a state where compromise is essential and no one solution is perfect, having content led administrators would be good for many things but not everything, so when good candidates come forward who will be a net positive to the project, even if they don't have a FA, GA, DYK and the triple crown, I feel we should support them and make use of the skills they offer the community.

However, I just don't see anything to make me believe that these things will actually ''be'' problems if the candidate becomes an administrator. I see plenty of evidence that the candidate listens thoughtfully to feedback and is ready to self-correct, and I see ''enough'' experience with content.

I have no worries that he will continue helping to improve Wikipedia with his new tools. I want to note, again, that I find "lack of content creation" to be a very poor reason to oppose. Wikipedia needs content contributors. Wikipedia needs editors interested in discussions and dispute resolution. Wikipedia needs gnomish editors. Wikipedia needs administrators. Some users are lucky enough to be part of more than one of those categories. Requiring RfA candidates to be content-oriented, discussion-oriented and maintenance-oriented all at once is really fucking stupid and it's the reason why hardly anybody wants to volunteer for an RfA, and even less make it through. Y'all need to [[WP:NBD|chill out]] and let people who want to help [[WP:NETPOS|actually do so]], as long as they're not grievously inexperienced or have shown poor behaviour or judgement.

But, on close inspection, that article was started by someone else and the candidate just expanded it.  Looking at the contributions for last October, I notice the creation of [[List of breweries in Idaho]].  This seems quite weak in that none of the entries are blue-links and the source is quite promotional in tone ("Visit Idaho").  And, as the candidate is quite proficient with redirects, it's surprising that he didn't go on to create redirects for the distinctive brewery names like [[Laughing Dog Brewery]].  As the candidate is a librarian, I would have expected them to do a better job by turning up sources like ''Beer and Brewing in the Inland Northwest, 1850 to 1950'' or ''Great American Craft Beer''.  My impression is that the candidate still has a lot to learn.

It is both extremely time consuming and under the radar for most editors. As one of the most backlogged areas, and even ahead of AFC, CCI also requires a tremendous understand of Wikipolicy due to the nuance in every use rationale that can come along. I have no concerns that this editor is light in other administrative areas; I've always supported the fact that we should trust editors with the tools where they need them, and to assume good faith that if they venture into other areas they will show the same responsibility they have shown up until this point.

This reminded me of [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sheepskin boots]], in which  the candidate seemed to prefer that we address the topic in a proprietary way, rather than a generic one.  This does not seem sufficiently neutral and so I am concerned that he might use admin tools in a partisan way.  It may well be that he is very sensible in other respects but as I am most familiar with that particular incident, I'll put the boot in :).

TXT:'''Oppose''' Bilby seems to be a very fine candidate in most respects. But Warden has highlighted a problem. On the [[Ugg boots trademark disputes]] article, there has been a series of Requests For Comment. The first one was closed improperly by an Australian problem editor who has been involved in repeated misconduct. The second one has an obvious meatpuppet case by another Australian editor described [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADpmuk&diff=555224192&oldid=555093685 here], and another possible case that is more subtle and much more damaging to Wikipedia described [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AUgg_boots_trademark_disputes&diff=553967503&oldid=553963004 here], also possibly involving several Australian editors. As I have said on the Talk page, it looks good but it smells bad. I think Bilby is a fine editor. He is the best Australian editor involved in that series of articles. But when the trouble started, he disappeared. Bilby has done nothing to counsel the problem editors from Australia and improve their behavior. Instead he has become their ally whenever they needed one. Therefore I am concerned that we are giving administrative powers to one side in a content dispute. I am also concerned that the first RFC was closed improperly, and the second may be closed improperly in a very similar way. Consensus should be determined by [[WP:CONSENSUS#Determining_consensus]]: "Consensus is determined by the quality of the arguments given on the various sides of an issue, as viewed through the lens of Wikipedia policy." The number of votes is not mentioned and should not matter. Also, in [[Wikipedia:Closing_discussions]]: "Consensus is not determined by counting heads." But the first RFC was closed by the Australian problem editor, by counting votes and ignoring policy arguments. The second time it was closed, the administrator admitted that one side had stronger policy arguments, but he allowed the larger number of votes on the other side to balance it, producing a "no consensus" result. This RFC needs greater participation by experienced editors who will rely on policy, not the number of votes. Bilby has voted on the side that has more votes and no policy arguments. Then he disappeared. This raises doubts about how he would use administrative tools if they are given to him. I regret I must oppose this nomination.

Although some (not all) of the opposers have made some valid points, on balance I believe the candidate is well-qualified to work as an administrator in the area of copyright enforcement, and will have the sense to move cautiously in other areas until he gains more experience in them. Given that the candidate has edited for nearly a decade, albeit not every day or every week, I don't see great risk in conferring adminship. That being said, if this RfA is unsuccessful, I hope the candidate will address the opposers' concerns and come back to this page in the future.

A cursory review of his [http://toolserver.org/~tparis/pcount/index.php?name=Darkwind&lang=en&wiki=wikipedia editing statistics] indicates that while his activity is indeed sporadic, he has still been a dedicated contributor for a long time with plenty of experience under his belt. I do not share the same concerns as some of the opposers regarding his answer to Q5 &mdash; he advocates an even application of [[WP:CIVIL|our civility policy]], but I trust his assurance that he would not block outside the bounds of reason. [[User:John F. Lewis|John F. Lewis]] is a relatively inexperienced nominator, but not an idiot; I'm confident that he recognized a good candidate in Darkwind and nominated him on that basis. Opposing someone because their nominator does not meet a certain threshold is ludicrous. Finally, I see no indication that Darkwind is lacking in communication skills, although the points raised by [[User:Dennis Brown|Dennis]], [[User:John|John]], [[User:Boing! said Zebedee|Boing]], et al are perfectly valid and were factored in before I opted to support.

On article content building (Q4), these additions are very minimal (though I love that the candidate is an Asimov fan!) and don't give sufficient evidence that as an admin Darkwind would have adequate understanding of the concerns of those of us who devote hours to building and polishing content. On Q5, this very vanilla answer gives no assurance that the candidate would not create more problems by blocking for minor breaches of civility. I needed to see some understanding of just what a delicate and nuanced area civility has become in recent years and this wasn't apparent in the answer. As Dennis says, there is little to no interaction in user talk to judge the candidate's people skills on either.

A serious candidate might be flattered by a new user making such a gesture, but they would be showing wisdom to have consulted with others; perhaps admins; prior to running. The nominator calls Darkwind one of his or her four "friends" on their user page and I consider that a bit conflicting. Take all the advice from this RfA and come back in 6 months. I think it will benefit you as well to be that prepared when you do get the tools. And there are many users here who will help you along over those six months, I'm sure. --

TXT:'''Oppose.''' I'm sorry, I know question 5 (civility enforcement) is very difficult and there certainly isn't one "correct" answer. But I'm not happy to see such a carefree, almost jaunty reply to it. Are you aware that, precisely, the question of what civility/incivility and egregious personal attacks ''are'' is tearing the community and the admin corps apart? (Your answer to Q 14, while fuller, doesn't exactly suggest such an awareness either.) You may be the only person I've ever seen using the phrase "clearly defined" in this area. I wouldn't oppose you for having opposite opinions on civility enforcement to my own, but I really think I must oppose somebody who doesn't appear to see the problems. Sorry. I'll be prepared to reconsider if you revise your answer a bit, or perhaps rather add to it, because it's not so much what you say as what you don't say. Adminship may not be a big deal, but it's not something to enter without having thought some about this, the most difficult, part of the job and showing some awareness of the inherent problems, and being willing to discuss them in a somewhat analytical and personal way. For instance, "preventative not punitive" is a very pious ideal, but what exactly does it mean? It's very easy to game. Many blocks are in my opinion obviously punitive (if you don't agree, please say so), but get defended as being intended to deter (=prevent) others from committing the same offence. If this is the actual situation, might it be better to rephrase the good old wikisaying as "blocks are not for revenge, but for prevention and for defining the limits of behaviour on Wikipedia" or something like that? That's just a thought, one example, I don't necessarily expect you to address that particular one. But I'd just like to see a little more depth in this answer, and more of your own personal opinions, too. Your current answer is superficial and by-the-book.

TXT:Regretful '''Oppose''', for a couple of reasons. I think gnome work is great, and in many ways gnomes are the unsung heroes of Wikipedia. But I think a suitable admin candidate needs to be able to demonstrate reasonably extensive interaction with other editors, with some experience of disputes or other problematic areas, so that we can get some idea of how they will handle interactions under pressure. Admin actions will get you into disputes, sometimes quite fraught ones, and getting the tone of interaction with others right can be very difficult - I have lots of experience of it, and I still get it wrong sometimes. Also, as others have suggested, I don't think I see a proper appreciation of the complexity of civility - it's something that has divided the community for some time, and it really is a lot more difficult than "talk nice or face action". I'd suggest getting involved in dispute resolution for a while. For example, look for newcomers having problems and try to help them out - there are plenty of places you can find disputes to help with. I look forward to being able to support a future admin run when I can see something of how you handle interaction and dispute. --

So no. (If the candidate wanted to concentrate in his areas of expertise, presumably copyright, Commons moves, Requested moves, then I think it is a big loss too, but it isn't his fault, since he has numerous years of proven stability, but the Admin tools are not broken up to give him what he needs in those areas. The candidate's responses to civility issues were shallow, but that squares with me as normal given no experience in contentious areas. And there is major lack of experience in content creation or building. I would not want to hand over the block button to the candidate under those circumstances unless either it was clear he was definitely not interested in going into areas like ANI and DELETION. We are losing a reliable hand here in the copyright and other areas, but that is not his fault, it is the fault that Admin tools are not broken up at all to support speciality areas, while keeping the block button and tools for other content-related areas separate and for other candidates with evidenced experience in the pertinent areas. [I'm not trying to open a thread here about why we don't separate the tools, but I am puzzled why WP hasn't made that logical move yet, and prefers to have these endless debates based on the same illogical point that 1) the Admin package includes all the tools, 2) an Admin candidate needs to be trusted in all the areas those tools apply, 3) it isn't realistic to expect a candidate to demonstrate trusted experience/knowledge in all those areas, and 4) that the candidate should re-apply to RfA after spending time boosting his experience/knowledge in those areas [even though the candidate may not have any interest in those areas -- which is like making someone eat "peas" when they may not like them]. For me ''that'' is why RfA is "broken"/dysfunctional, because the tools are not divided up but come in one package only. And not because of nitpicking.

And while he provides a lot of help over at copyvio and aiv, which are great efforts, there has been little engagement beyond cleaning up quick fixes as one-offs. Lack of dispute or conflict is likely due to this sort of one-off edits. It concerns me that he wants tools but doesn't want to specifically stay within a specific realm, but roam around with admin tools. I might be more inclined if he specifically stuck to one area and showed a depth of experience in that area; or conversely, if the desire is to roam, then he needs more experience in other areas to support his use of tools in these other areas.

Besides it's bizarre to pretend that the deletion policy is something so complex that two years of dutiful study are required to grasp it. When entering an area where they have limited experience, longtime, responsible and clueful editors like INeverCry don't come crashing in like a bull in a china shop.

TXT:'''Support'''. I have to admit that I think there are too many questions for candidates at RfA, and I generally do not like asking them. I asked Q12 this time because I saw a request for such a question on the RfA talk page, and it struck me as a reasonable request. But the question I asked is a sufficiently tricky one that it can lend itself to being a "gotcha", which is something I generally disapprove of in RfA. All of that is a long way of getting around to saying that, for me, this RfA comes down to evaluating whether I trust a candidate who has a strong track record at Commons to understand how to deal with ''content'', rather than files, here. I'm entirely satisfied. Q12 deals with a situation that actually comes up rather regularly at [[WP:FFD]], pitting a nominator who is a stickler for limiting the use of non-free files (not permitted at Commons, and an important difference between there and here) against a content editor who sees the value of the particular image for the particular content. I don't want admins doing file work who fail to listen to the content editors. The cautious answer, along with the honest admissions elsewhere in the RfA of mistakes from which the candidate has learned, tell me that this is someone who is going to be careful to do no harm. Although a lot of the editing history here has been gnomish edits and work on list pages, I looked carefully at the editing history of [[George Crabbe]], and I find clear evidence of actual sourcing and content work. Taking that all together, I'm fully comfortable that this is someone who can work administratively with image files while understanding what goes into serious content creation. --

The candidate chose to give up his/her access because he/she did not like a discussion that was happening on the OTRS wiki; even though the action INeverCry disagreed with has no chance of happening, that there was even a discussion on it was enough for the candidate to decide that he/she no longer wanted to be a part of the OTRS community.

However, WP administrative knowledge and competence are important and complex, and when absent, resolve to a trust issue of a less personal but no less pertinent kind.  I would happily support in 6 months if I saw a lot more involvement in XfDs, AN/ANI, etc., not just content work and things relating to moving images to Commons.

Yet, in my experience, the community has often expressed a concern about the problems of having a smaller set of "full-time admins," putatively detached from the concerns of writing and editing an encyclopedia. The alternative to that model is a larger set of "part-time admins", and in many ways, I think there's a strong argument that that's the way we should be trending.)

TXT:'''Support''' - Responsible editor with plenty of experience. I see little risk in giving Jason Quinn a few extra buttons. I'm puzzled by the opposes as it seemed to me that "no need for tools" had recently been going out of style as a reason to oppose an RfA. Now it's making a comeback as "being bored is not a good reason for wanting the tools" but it seems obvious to me that this is JQ's way of saying "I'd like to explore other ways of helping out". I would suggest that everyone who's worked on Wikipedia for more than two or three years (and that includes many of the opposes below) knows that feeling. You join Wikipedia to work on articles about 19th-century entomologists, you get a little jaded and you start coordinating WikiProject Insects. That slowly becomes less interesting so you switch gears and start doing some anti-vandalism work but that's only interesting and challenging for a few months and you decide that your time would be better spent in improving Wikipedia's coverage of Tanzanian culture. I suspect that "I'm kinda bored and am looking for new challenges" is actually a very typical motivation in RfA candidates. People are also opposing because of Q1's "there's very little I intend to do" but again, if giving JQ the tools means 5 fewer edit-requests a year, then this is a net positive.

Anyone who's been active here for '''nine years''' with no problems can be trusted, and everyone who can be trusted should be an admin unless they don't want to.  In particular, I don't understand why people simultaneously oppose for "bored" and for "I'm just going to edit protected pages" — if you're bored, you'll probably find yourself fulfilling lots of other admin tasks as well.  Since it's just a technical matter that sysop powers aren't given to everyone, you should have them if you qualify.  Finally, it's not as if we have a limited number of admins, so there's nothing wrong with giving tools to a trustworthy person who will use them only rarely, and every protected page that Jason edits is one less task for the rest of the admins to worry about.

TXT:''Support''. 7+ years, nearly 20k edits, doesn't appear to have broken the wiki, and no one has raised any conduct issues or skulduggery. Says he won't do much with the tools, so am not terribly concerned whether he is up on the latest alphabet soup of policies or criteria, seems to have a head on his shoulders in discussion. The concern raised in the opposes I find unpersuasive - I flipped through a few of the articles raised as concerning and see embryonic articles that could be made better, but not concerning.

TXT:'''Support.''' I have never actually had any interaction with Jason but after looking at his contributions, intentions and answers to questions I feel that having the admin flag would benefit the project. He is honest, as shown in question 1, has far more content writing under his belt than I did when I flaged and nothing shows that he would missuse the tools. His intentions are all good and nodoubt he would help out with current admin team. I hope the closing crat reads all of the supports and opposes carfully as there are some really 'special' ones out there which seem to have very little, if any reasoning behind them. As Filelakeshoe said in a comment "adminship wasn't a big deal" and in years past anyone would be handed the flag as long as their intentions were good and they had a little evidence of that. Jason has both good intentions and a massive history to back it up. '''

And I think people are taking the "bored" thing rather too seriously - it's just a light-hearted comment. Anyway, I'm here in the support camp essentially because Jason Quinn is someone I trust with the tools, based on his long term service and clearly good work. (As an aside, I think the ability to edit protected pages, especially templates that are protected because of their ubiquity and/or complexity, is an obvious case for unbundling - it's an "expert" action, not an "admin" action, and when they are edited, admins just do what the experts tell them.) --

The amount of "no need" opposes is surprising, especially given how we've never had a shortage of mops to give out and how much complaining there is at the declining number of admins. Jason Quinn has been around for close to decade, has had a relatively stable edit rate for the past several years and his last RfA was over five years ago; I think he'd be a safe person to have as an administrator.

Even if they only used it once a year, why not give it to them? Adminship is not a scarce resource or limited good. For some reason, at Wikipedia we only hand out the corkscrew in a [[:File:Wenger EvoGrip S17.JPG|package along with other tools]]. From what I've read, I am confident that this editor won't abuse the knife, saw, or scissors. In my own very biased opinion, some of the best admins here use their tools infrequently and specifically, when it helps them do what they'd be doing anyway, as editors.

This would be very difficult and time-consuming. My original oppose was based on the fact that the user would be using the tools for him/herself, and not benefiting the community as a good admin should do. My evidence for this was that the user said they would like to edit protected pages. At first I thought this meant so they could edit without using {{tl|editprotected}}, basically for convenience. Now I reconsider however. The user has, as I already stated above, said different, stating they would like to undertake a basically admin-only project.

The admin side can be extremely busy sometimes, especially if there's not many of us online.  Plus, if you're bored of the encyclopedia what's to say that once you've mastered the admin tools you won't become bored of them too?  Thirdly, in an RFA you'd ideally have to show evidence of how you've coped when coming into conflict with another editor as it then shows us how you interact with others and how you would deal with conflict.

The candidate is certainly experienced and trustworthy and has made significant contributions to the project. I don't think that any RfA candidate has to demonstrate any kind of a "need" for the tools. However, Mephistophelian raises valid concerns and I find the candidate's response at this RFA's talk page troubling rather than reassuring. I do not believe that any adminship candidate needs to necessarily have any FA,GA or DYK  articles in their record.  Different people contribute to the project in different ways, and, for example, concentrating on gnomish work is perfectly fine. But I do think that any experienced user, and most certainly any admin candidate, needs to make sure that the new content they do create is taken to some basic level of acceptability, at the very least to the level of a respectable stub. By that I mean a stub where at least the main basic facts are expressly referenced to [[WP:RS]] and notability of the topic is made apparent to a casual passer-by. After that is done, it is perfectly fine to leave the article in peace and let other users work on expanding it.  But creating completely unsourced stubs and leaving them in the mainspace as easy targets for PRODding/AfDing or at least for getting slapped with ugly maintenance tags is not OK. In this case the candidate has created quite a few stubs that I would consider sub-par and below the standard of being a minimally respectable stub. E.g. the articles [[Crotaphion]], [[Apoquindo Waterfall]], [[Andreas Airfield]], [[Wildlife of Chile]], [[Salar de Pedernales]] and [[Sharp map]] remain completely unsourced even now (and even after concerns about them have been raised in this RfA). The [[Crotaphion]] article was created in April 2012, not 7-8 years ago (when    unsourced articles were viewed as more acceptable).

His problems with working on [[WP:REFTOOLS]] is a valid concern, but one I'd prefer to solve with a different set of permissions - indeed, Jason himself has suggested he would prefer this. The guy's kept his nose clean and stayed out of trouble, and long may he continue to do so.

TXT:'''Support''' absolutely. Legoktm is an extremely clueful and helpful editor, and exactly the sort of person who should be an administrator. Regarding the oppose section, I do think that "AFD accuracy" is a terrible reason to oppose. We require that administrators understand policy and know how to judge a consensus. But there is no requirement that every administrator agree with consensus. In fact, I think Wikipedia would be far worse if "agreeing with the majority on most issues" was a prerequisite for getting the bit. I'm confident that Lego will acknowledge consensus when it appears, and that's all that matters.

When the AFD is closed, all the arguments are seen and can be evaluated--during the process, the arguments are still being formed.  If "AFD Accuracy" is the measure to be an administrator, then all we need is someone with 100% predictability.  We wouldn't need to have the discussion in the first place.  But we have the discussions, and I think we are better off hearing both sides and not just one side on any topic. A good faith editor.--

The history of this is that the candidate tried to speedy delete the topic within 5 minutes of its creation.  Over the next day, the topic is greatly expanded with dozens of sources and the speedy is refused but the candidate then takes it to AFD.  The result is a snow keep and only then does the candidate conclude that the topic is "obviously notable" when a simple google search would have told him this at the outset.

Although I find no reason to oppose the subject outright, and am sure that given the current straw poll results that the subject will be given the Admin tools, I would be more inclined to voting in support of the subject if the subject had more experience in content creation. I understand that content creation is not everyone's preference, but at the core of Wikipedia is the content which has become a valuable resources to the millions of readers of the millions of articles which make up Wikipedia. Without having experience in creating content up to higher levels of quality, it maybe more difficult for an Admin to tackle some critical areas that the community has asked Admins to oversee.

However, the query was rather indirect and unfocused, and the clerk has the sometimes tough job of herding cats ''to focus,'' and is bound to step on toes -- in the end it seems that action was within not unreasonable bounds for that job, even if not perfect (also, the issue in the view of the oppose was in fact hashed out elsewhere, so no irremediable foul).

TXT:'''Support''' I think the opposition is sensible, but so is the defense to them.  Maybe LR's actions at the Fæ Arb case were wrong, but also maybe they weren't.  They were questionable, but within the domain of reasonable discourse.  They weren't gross inadequacies.  Now, if all of LR's actions were merely defensible, and none indubitably good, then there would be no question of his inadmissibility.  However, this is just one questionable case among many indubitably good. I think his content creation was good: If it was done merely to establish his credentials for this RfA and for ArbCom, I don't think that matters, as admins are not required to be content creators but merely, I think, should be familiar with the intricacies of it.  Having made an FA and a GA I think shows that he has this familiarity.  Finally, I think if an admin acts in the model established in LordRoem's history, then the project would be, overall, improved. --<font face="georgia">

TXT:'''Oppose''', but I'm open to persuasion. In a change from what often happens in RfAs, I actually supported last time, but oppose now. In that last RfA, there were questions about the candidate's clerking in an arbitration case that was going on at the same time as that RfA. I supported, and specifically commented that I thought that the clerking looked just fine to me. Very shortly after, I ended up feeling like I had put my foot in my mouth. I raised what I ''know'' was an appropriate question, one that the arbitrators ought to follow, on the evidence talk page. Then, this: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AArbitration%2FRequests%2FCase%2FF%C3%A6%2FEvidence&diff=497602019&oldid=497601788], happened. I asked Lord Roem about it on his talk page, and got what I feel was an insufficient answer: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lord_Roem&diff=prev&oldid=497603690]. I explained further: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lord_Roem&diff=next&oldid=497605879]. The discussion that I tried to start on the evidence talk ended up moving to my own talk page, and many editors commented that it shed more light than just about anything else in that case. Ironically, I know that some of the arbitrators followed it there, because some of them made comments there. Some of the users who opposed the last RfA said that Lord Roem seems very focused on having the position of administrator, but lacked the nuances of judgment that are needed. They were right and I was wrong, then. If you parse his response to me, in the diff above, there's nothing grossly wrong: it's professional and workmanly. But it just doesn't ''get it''. Now, that said, I began by saying that I'm open to persuasion, and I am. Please feel free to pile on. But I'm not looking for an ArbCom circling of the wagons, so please don't tell me that the arbs supported the hatting. What I ''am'' looking for is convincing evidence of growth and learning. --

Salvio actually sums it up fairly well, but as I articulated last time, Lord Roem isn't independent enough to be an effective admin.  I think he means well, but he does seem to take the "popular side" as Salvio puts it.  Admin '''must''' be neutral and use their own discretion, or non-admin can't trust their judgement.  Assuming this passes, I sincerely hope Lord Roem separates himself from the pack and will use his own common sense and judgement, rather than go along with the crowd.  While there may be safety in numbers, blindly taking the lead from others is very damaging to retention and overall morale around here, and fuels the (incorrect) assumption of "cabals". There is a fine line between "getting along" and "jumping on the bandwagon", and I sincerely hope that if you get the bit, you are able to make that distinction.

TXT:Agree with Dennis Brown, though I don't think waiting a bit would change my opinion. The populist politics are concerning, but not all that trouble me about this candidate. I like to see significant content contributions from admins. Some like to see FAs or GAs. I personally think FA/GA can be more about proper formatting rather than writing a comprehensive encyclopedia article, but it usually shows how one responds to criticism. FA/GA at RfA ''should'' be about two things: showing that actual writing of the encyclopedia is a top priority and showing collaboration with other users. The FA/GAs appear to have been written out of a desire to pass RfA (and subsequent Arbcom). Further, they were written entirely by Lord Roem and show no collaboration with others. The topics were simply not interesting enough for anyone else to even start a stub on the topic.[http://toolserver.org/~daniel/WikiSense/Contributors.php?wikilang=en&wikifam=.wikipedia.org&grouped=on&page=Taylor_v._Illinois] In [[Taylor v. Illinois]], there are 3 listed references plus the primary source opinion/judgement/ruling/whatever. One of the references (Stocker) is used only once, one (Atkinson) is used 12 times, and the third (Heiderscheit) is used 5 times. Basically, this "good" article is based on one source. But there are so many <nowiki><ref></nowiki> tags thrown in there it appears as if the article is well sourced. This isn't to say the article is not needed on Wikipedia, but it does show that you are more interested in ticking off the boxes needed to make a Good Article rather than writing a good article. The same argument goes for the FA written by Lord Roem, and probably the other content contributions though I haven't looked in-depth. -

His very high percentage in AfD where his !vote was the same as the outcome usually speaks to me of a yes-man who only puts their opinion in after they already know which way the AfD is likely to go, simply parroting the same opinion as someone above them. After an hour of looking through his contributions, I found this wasn't the case at all.

TXT:'''Oppose''' I too have looked at this material, and I agree with Unscintillating-- there is not a single AfD comment that shows any effort to actually look at the article under discussion, let alone took for sources. A me-too vote is when the editor simply echos a previous comment taking it on faith that the previous comment represented the true state of affairs. Naturally, considering the great number of articles we unfortunately get submitted on football players who do not  meet our standards, commenting "delete" on everyone listed as such will be right almost all the time. As here. I would be nowhere as concerned if the candidate had not stated an intent to concentrate on this area.  '''

TXT:I'd like the closing crat to understand my "neutral" comment as actually being very close to "support", and it's clear to me that this RfA is going to be successful. But I've had to think unusually hard and for an unusually long time about this RfA, and I think that my concerns can get a bit more attention here than they would have gotten in the support section. I hope that the candidate will regard what I say as friendly feedback, because I'm saying it in that spirit. Obviously, anyone with this extensive a track record is a trustworthy contributor to the project. And I put a lot of faith in nominations by Mr. Strad. Nevertheless, I actually find a lot of substance in the much-maligned opposes. Is it a problem if someone who tends to follow the crowd closes AfDs? Actually, we kind of want admins to follow the consensus, rather than force a super-vote over consensus. And we absolutely should never disqualify an RfA candidate whose subject interests are disliked, so long as they are within the scope of what passes [[WP:NOT]]. But I kind of agree with DGG that we have too many low-quality fan-cruft pages about sports persons, and I want to make sure that closing admins will exert critical thinking instead of just following "keep" !votes. Does it matter if an admin is careless about grammar? Well, it's not a disqualifier, but put yourself in the shoes of a user who ended up on the losing side of an admin decision, and finds that decision explained with an obvious language error. It shakes confidence, and that undermines the project. So I have more sympathy for those editors who oppose the candidate, than the majority here appears to have. But I believe that the candidate will take this feedback constructively, and if he does, he'll probably do fine as an administrator. --

For me, editor contributions at AFD are about consensus building, while admin closes at AFD are about consensus reading. I don't think one necessarily makes for good practice for the other. Take RFPP for example - how are you supposed to "learn RFPP" as a non-admin? By making lots of requests? [[User:Salvidrim|Salvidrim]] was recently granted the bit, jumped in at RFPP and made some cracking calls, including rejecting one of the half-arsed, half-asleep requests I made in frustration late one night.

It is always a good idea to add sources to an article that needs better references, of course, but it is only whether the sources ''exist'' that affects the subject's notability. Also, these two comments[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Jean-Claude_Bigu%C3%A9&diff=518243373&oldid=518126639][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Next_Nature&diff=518244460&oldid=517242531] suggest that the articles in question should be deleted for having a promotional tone.

If there are no other problems, these kinds of articles [[WP:NOTCLEANUP|should be cleaned up]], by reducing them to stubs if necessary, but not deleted. I almost opposed over these comments and the general lack of experience at AfD, but Miniapolis is otherwise a great editor, and she could do very useful work in other areas.

I do not believe that person would cause damage.  I am concerned about Miniapolis though.  When you come to RfA and you answer the first question with an admin area, I want to see experience.  Am I punishing someone for offering to do work?  Maybe.  But I don't see it that way.  When someone wants to work an area they have no experience, they can potentially cause damage.  Further, ANI should be the ending place that admins work, not the start.  A brand new sysop should not ''start'' at ANI.  New sysops should start at RFPP, UAA, PROD and PERM.  Areas that are the least controversial.  What this boils down to is that I am not confident that Miniapolis is aware of their limits.  I'm sorry.--v/r -

Three of six nominations (using Snottywong's stats) should not have been nominated and Miniapolis seems to believe that it's ok to send articles to AfD without checking if sources exist. In [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Marcel Boucher]] she wrote "''I'm up to my neck in cleanup work as it is and have no dog in this fight; the burden of proof to provide reliable sources rests with the editor(s) who want the article kept.''" It's true that a lot of unreferenced junk needs to be deleted (as well as a significant chunk of kinda-sorta-referenced junk) and I'd probably argue that too many things are kept at AfD. But AfD is not a place to give "clean it up or it dies" ultimatums.

I don't feel the delete function should be given to editors who don't always make time to check for sources before deciding to delete, especially in the context of PRODs where the deleting admin might be the only experienced editor to look over the article. Additionally, "This BLP is not well-sourced in English (almost all sources are untranslated Hungarian)" ([[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Gábor Koltai]]) & "as sources, they should contain enough of a translation to demonstrate that they verify the material" ([[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Change 123]]) both suggest a lack of understanding that sources need not be in English.

TXT:'''Weak oppose'''. Sigh. I don't want to be here when a candidate is clearly a good, likable, and conscientious editor. Edits and tenure are fine. My problem is when a candidate says they want to work in X, then I will judge with reference to X. ANI is about conflict, but Q3 doesn't describe experience with conflict. I'd expect an editor with 9K article/talk edits to have bumped into some difficult editors; the candidate has apparently avoided that learning experience. The desire to work in ANI is odd given edit stats imply < 63 edits to ANI; editors don't have to be admins to comment there. AfD is also mentioned, but the experience there is minimal and the main diagonal is poor. Q8 gives an explanation about using policy arguments in AfD comments, but Northamerica1000's question misleads with "congruent with other editor opinions". The AfD stats show congruence with the closing admin's determination of consensus and not whether one voted with or against the crowd. That's a subtle but important distinction; policy arguments should trump a majority w/o policy; a poor main diagonal indicates a problem with applying policy rather than failing to follow the crowd. Examining some AfDs leaves me more uncomfortable; the experience/judgment is not there. For a candidate who wants to work at ANI and AfD, I need to see better evidence of good judgment. I want to go the other way, but 68% is difficult to swallow. It looks like you'll get the bit; please be careful with it.
